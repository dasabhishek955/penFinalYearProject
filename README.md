# Project Report on Industrial Automation Technique Using YOLO-A Deep Learning Tool
- YOLO stands for 'You only look once', is an object detection algorithm that divides images into a grid system. Each cell in the grid is responsible for detecting objects within it.<br>
- Deep learning has revolutionized some fields of technology in the past few years and will touch many others soon. One of these could be industrial automation, though traditionally a reluctant environment to adopt new technologies.<br>
We propose a novel and robust color object detection and localization algorithm. Without priority information about the number of objects, our method can detect all the things with similar color features in the template.<br>
- A SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and critical points matching algorithm is used to find the object candidate regions. The weighted histogram intersection is used to verify the presence of objects. With the color feature in the template, our method can detect and locate the objects accurately, get the number of objects, and estimate their scales and orientations. Our experimental results on outdoor images obtained under different environments verify the
effectiveness of our algorithm.
